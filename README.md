# Pleines_C_Sudoku
Thank you for looking into my code and Github portfolio.
This code validates if the Sudoku board contained within is correctly completed per a normal 9x9 Sudoku setup with integers 1-9.

It will evaluate that the inputs are integers, the integers are 1-9, and that there is no integer repetition in the rows, columns, or 'blocks'.
The Sudoku board is hardcoded into the same code that evaluates it. Unfortunately, this does mean that a compiler is required to demonstrate the validity of this code.

Written in C, this served mostly as a proof-of-concept to myself that I understand this low level language. 
I have successfully tested all 3 'flags' of correct, incorrect, and invalid boards.

While I would be interested in making this Sudoku Solver scalable,  I had seen some discussion that the concept of checking the length of the array input is not possible.
Should I find information contrary in the near future, I will likely update this to be a scalable solver (for any 1x1, 4x4, 9x9, 16x16, etc boards).

If you enjoy the code and are looking for more programmers, please consider adding me to your team.
